# LIFTING LOG

## Description

This app is designed for avid gym goers who want a concrete record of their progress. It's motivating to see how much stronger you've become within a few quick clicks. 

However, lifting weights isn't all about how many pounds you add to the bar. It's impossible to use more weight every single workout. But you can also reduce rest periods and do more reps to increase the challenge. Our app allows people to measure all progress metrics.
